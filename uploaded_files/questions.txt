Sign-magnitude representation
The sign of a number is stored as an additional piece of information.
This corresponds to our usual mathematical notation
+3, -102
One of the bits, usually the left-most, is used for the sign. The remainder of the sequence represents the absolute value of the number
We use 0 for + and 1 for -
In a 4-bit representation
+3 is represented as 0011
-3 is represented as 1011
