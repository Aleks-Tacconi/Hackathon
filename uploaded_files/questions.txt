Binary Representations
Sign-magnitude
First Bit represents the sign of the number.
Examples (4 bits): 0001= 1 and 1001= -1.
Converting to Denary: Ignore first bit and add up the rest. First bit is sign.
Range: -2n-1 – 1 to  2n-1 – 1 so for 4 bits it would be -7 to 7.
Note: Has two representations of 0, 0000 = 0 and 1000 = -0.

=======
Sign-magnitude representation
The sign of a number is stored as an additional piece of information.
This corresponds to our usual mathematical notation
+3, -102
One of the bits, usually the left-most, is used for the sign. The remainder of the sequence represents the absolute value of the number
We use 0 for + and 1 for -
In a 4-bit representation
+3 is represented as 0011
-3 is represented as 1011
