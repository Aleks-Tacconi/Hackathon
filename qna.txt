What is sign-magnitude representation?%%%%%A method of representing signed numbers where the sign and magnitude are stored separately, typically using the leftmost bit for the sign.

Q: How is a positive number represented in sign-magnitude?  
A: The leftmost bit is 0, followed by the magnitude in binary.

Q: How is a negative number represented in sign-magnitude?  
A: The leftmost bit is 1, followed by the magnitude in binary.

Q: What is the range of an 8-bit sign-magnitude number?  
A: -127 to +127.

Q: What is the main drawback of sign-magnitude representation?  
A: It has two representations for zero: +0 and -0.

Q: How do you convert a decimal number to sign-magnitude?  
A: Determine the sign, convert the absolute value to binary, and set the sign bit accordingly.

Q: Can sign-magnitude numbers be easily added and subtracted?  
A: No, it requires special handling for the sign bits during arithmetic operations.

Q: How many bits are needed in sign-magnitude for a number with a range of -15 to +15?  
A: 5 bits (1 bit for the sign and 4 bits for the magnitude).
What does the first bit in binary representation signify?%%%%%The sign of the number.
