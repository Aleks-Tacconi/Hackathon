What is sign-magnitude representation?%%%%%A method to represent signed integers where the first bit indicates the sign and the remaining bits represent the magnitude.  

Q: How do you determine the sign in sign-magnitude representation?  
A: The first bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative) indicates the sign.  

Q: What is the range of values for an 8-bit sign-magnitude representation?  
A: -127 to +127.  

Q: How is zero represented in sign-magnitude representation?  
A: Both +0 (00000000) and -0 (10000000) exist, causing ambiguity.  

Q: What are the main drawbacks of sign-magnitude representation?  
A: Complexity in arithmetic operations and representation of two zeros.  

Q: How do you convert a positive decimal number to sign-magnitude?  
A: Set the sign bit to 0 and the remaining bits to the binary equivalent of the magnitude.  

Q: How do you convert a negative decimal number to sign-magnitude?  
A: Set the sign bit to 1 and the remaining bits to the binary equivalent of the magnitude.
