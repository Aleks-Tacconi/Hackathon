What is sign-magnitude?%%%%%A representation of signed numbers using one bit for the sign and the rest for the magnitude.  

Q: How is the sign indicated in sign-magnitude?  
A: The sign is indicated by the most significant bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative).  

Q: What is the range of an 8-bit sign-magnitude number?  
A: -127 to +127.  

Q: How do you convert a positive number to sign-magnitude?  
A: Set the most significant bit to 0 and use the remaining bits for the absolute value.  

Q: How do you convert a negative number to sign-magnitude?  
A: Set the most significant bit to 1 and use the remaining bits for the absolute value.  

Q: Is sign-magnitude commonly used in modern computing?  
A: No, it is less common than two's complement.  

Q: What is a drawback of sign-magnitude representation?  
A: It has two representations for zero (+0 and -0).  

Q: What is the simplest method for adding sign-magnitude numbers?  
A: Convert to decimal, add, and convert back to sign-magnitude.  

Q: How do you represent the number -5 in sign-magnitude using 8 bits?  
A: 10000101.  

Q: What happens during the addition of two sign-magnitude numbers with different signs?  
A: Subtract the magnitudes and keep the sign of the larger magnitude.
