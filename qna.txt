1. What does the sign-magnitude representation store as an additional piece of information?%%%%%The sign of a number.
2. In sign-magnitude representation, what does the left-most bit typically represent?%%%%%The sign of the number.
3. How is the positive sign represented in sign-magnitude format?%%%%%0.
4. How is the negative sign represented in sign-magnitude format?%%%%%1.
5. What is the 4-bit representation for the number +3?%%%%%0011.
6. What is the 4-bit representation for the number -3?%%%%%1011.
7. In sign-magnitude representation, how is the absolute value of a number represented?%%%%%By the remainder of the bit sequence after the sign bit.
8. What does the bit sequence "1101" represent in sign-magnitude if we assume the first bit is the sign?%%%%%-1.
9. If a 4-bit sequence begins with a 0, what does that indicate about the number?%%%%%The number is positive.
10. Can you represent the number -102 in 4-bit sign-magnitude format?%%%%%No, because -102 cannot be represented within the 4-bit limit.
