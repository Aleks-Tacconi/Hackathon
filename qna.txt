What is sign-magnitude representation?%%%%%A binary encoding system for representing signed numbers, where the most significant bit indicates the sign.  

Q: How is the sign represented in sign-magnitude?  
A: 0 for positive and 1 for negative.  

Q: What does the remaining bits represent?  
A: The magnitude of the number.  

Q: What is the range for an 8-bit sign-magnitude representation?  
A: -127 to +127.  

Q: Is there a representation for zero in sign-magnitude?  
A: Yes, there are two representations: +0 and -0.  

Q: What is a drawback of sign-magnitude representation?  
A: It has two representations for zero and is less efficient for arithmetic operations.  

Q: How do you convert a positive decimal number to sign-magnitude?  
A: Convert to binary and add a 0 as the most significant bit.  

Q: How do you convert a negative decimal number to sign-magnitude?  
A: Convert the absolute value to binary and add a 1 as the most significant bit.
What does the sign of a number indicate?%%%%%Whether the number is positive or negative.

Q: How is the sign typically represented in numeric systems?  
A: With a plus (+) for positive and minus (-) for negative.

Q: What is the sign of zero?  
A: Neutral; it has no sign.

Q: Can a number have multiple signs at once?  
A: No, a number has one sign at a time.

Q: What is the sign of -5?  
A: Negative.

Q: What is the sign of +10?  
A: Positive.

Q: In computing, how might the sign of a number be represented?  
A: Using a sign bit.

Q: What does the term "signed number" mean?  
A: A number that includes a sign indicator (positive or negative).

Q: What does "unsigned number" mean?  
A: A number that only represents non-negative values.

Q: Can the sign of a number change?  
A: Yes, it can change based on operations.
What is the formula for the area of a circle?%%%%%A = πr²  

Q: How do you calculate the slope of a line?  
A: Slope (m) = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁)  

Q: What is the quadratic formula?  
A: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a  

Q: What is Pythagoras' theorem?  
A: a² + b² = c²  

Q: What is the exponential function?  
A: f(x) = e^x  

Q: What does the derivative of a function represent?  
A: The rate of change of the function.  

Q: What is the integral of a function?  
A: The area under the curve of the function.  

Q: What is the sum of interior angles in a triangle?  
A: 180 degrees.  

Q: What are the three laws of thermodynamics?  
A: 1) Energy conservation, 2) Entropy increases, 3) Absolute zero is unattainable.  

Q: What is the formula for the circumference of a circle?  
A: C = 2πr or C = πd.
