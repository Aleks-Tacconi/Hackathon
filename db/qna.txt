1. What is a word in the context of computer data?%%%%%A word is a fixed-sized unit of data that a processor can handle as a single unit.
2. What is the largest number that a 64-bit word can hold in unsigned representation?%%%%%The largest number that a 64-bit word can hold is 2^64-1.
3. How many bits are in a byte?%%%%%A byte is 8 bits.
4. What is the largest byte-sized number represented in binary?%%%%%The largest byte-sized number is 255, which is represented as binary 11111111.
5. What is the default integer type in Java and how many bits does it use?%%%%%The default integer type in Java is int, which uses 32 bits.
6. Describe the sign-magnitude representation method for negative numbers.%%%%%In sign-magnitude representation, one of the bits (usually the left-most) indicates the sign (0 for positive and 1 for negative), while the remaining bits represent the absolute value of the number.
7. What is a limitation of the sign-magnitude representation when performing arithmetic?%%%%%A limitation is that adding two negative numbers does not work correctly, and it also has the issue of representing two different zeros.
8. What range of values does excess representation cover if n = 8?%%%%%If n = 8, excess representation covers values from -128 (00000000) to 127 (11111111).
9. How is arithmetic performed with excess representation?%%%%%To perform arithmetic in excess representation, you must add x + 2^(n-1) and y + 2^(n-1), then subtract 2^(n-1) from the result.
10. Can the bias be changed when using excess representation?%%%%%Yes, it is possible to change the bias when using excess representation.
