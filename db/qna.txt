1. What is the sign-magnitude representation of +3 in a 4-bit format?%%%%%0011
2. How is -3 represented in sign-magnitude using 4 bits?%%%%%1011
3. What is one major issue when adding two negative numbers in sign-magnitude representation?%%%%%It does not work correctly (results in incorrect arithmetic).
4. In a sign-magnitude system, how many distinct representations of zero are there?%%%%%Two (positive zero and negative zero).
5. What is the range of numbers that can be represented in excess representation with n = 8?%%%%%-128 to 127
6. In excess representation for n = 8, what bit string represents the value 0?%%%%%01111111 (with a bias of 128).
7. How do you compute the sum of two numbers x and y in excess representation?%%%%%x + 2^(n-1) + y + 2^(n-1) - 2^(n-1).
8. What is the bias in a typical excess representation system when n = 8?%%%%%0
9. Can the bias be altered in excess representation?%%%%%Yes, it is possible to change the bias.
10. What is the primary advantage of using excess representation over sign-magnitude?%%%%%Arithmetic operations are more straightforward and consistent.
