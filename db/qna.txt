1. What does sign-magnitude representation correspond to in mathematical notation?%%%%%It corresponds to our usual mathematical notation, such as +3 and -102.
2. In sign-magnitude representation, how is the sign of a number stored?%%%%%The sign is stored as an additional piece of information, typically using the left-most bit, with 0 for + and 1 for -.
3. What is the 4-bit representation of +3 in sign-magnitude representation?%%%%%0011
4. How is -3 represented in 4-bit sign-magnitude format?%%%%%1011
5. What arithmetic operations work correctly in sign-magnitude representation?%%%%%Adding two positive numbers and adding two negative numbers work correctly.
6. What is a significant drawback of the sign-magnitude representation regarding zero?%%%%%There are two representations for zero, which is wasteful of representation.
7. In excess representation, what is the range of values when n = 8?%%%%%-128 to 127
8. What binary string represents -128 in an 8-bit excess representation?%%%%%00000000
9. How do you perform addition in excess representation?%%%%%You calculate x + 2^(n-1) + y + 2^(n-1), then subtract 2^(n-1) to decode the result.
10. Can the bias be changed in excess representation?%%%%%Yes, it is possible to change the bias when using excess representation.
