Sure! Here are ten questions based on the provided content, along with their answers:
1. What does sign-magnitude representation utilize to indicate the sign of a number?%%%%%An additional bit, usually the left-most bit, is used for the sign.
2. In a 4-bit sign-magnitude representation, how is +3 represented?%%%%%+3 is represented as 0011.
3. What are the representations for -3 in a 4-bit sign-magnitude system?%%%%%-3 is represented as 1011.
4. What is a major arithmetic issue with the sign-magnitude representation when adding two negative numbers?%%%%%Adding two negative numbers does not produce the correct result.
5. Describe the range of numbers represented in excess representation when n = 8.%%%%%The range goes from -128 (00000000) to 127 (11111111).
6. How does excess representation achieve its range of values?%%%%%Excess representation starts at -2^(n-1) and goes up to 2^(n-1) - 1.
7. In excess representation, where does the value 0 fall when written in alphanumeric order?%%%%%0 will be just below the middle, with positive numbers below and negative numbers above.
8. What is the bias when using excess representation with n = 8?%%%%%The bias is 0.
9. What is the formula to calculate the result of x + y in excess representation?%%%%%The formula is x + y + 2^(n-1).
10. What must be done after performing the arithmetic operation in excess representation to get the final answer?%%%%%You must subtract 2^(n-1) and decode the result.
