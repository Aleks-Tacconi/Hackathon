1. What is the primary purpose of using sign-magnitude representation in binary?%%%%%To store the sign of a number as an additional piece of information alongside its absolute value.
2. In a 4-bit sign-magnitude representation, how is +3 represented?%%%%%0011
3. How is -3 represented in a 4-bit sign-magnitude representation?%%%%%1011
4. What is one significant issue with arithmetic operations in sign-magnitude representation?%%%%%Adding two negative numbers does not work correctly.
5. What does the excess representation system start and end with when n = 8?%%%%%-128 to 127
6. In excess representation, what is the bias when n = 8?%%%%%0
7. How would you compute x + y in excess representation?%%%%%x + 2^(n-1) + y + 2^(n-1) - 2^(n-1)
8. What is one of the disadvantages of the sign-magnitude representation besides arithmetic issues?%%%%%There are two representations for zero, wasting a representation.
9. In the context of excess representation, what does the value 00000000 represent if n = 8?%%%%%-128
10. Can the bias in excess representation be adjusted?%%%%%Yes, the bias can be changed when using excess representation.
