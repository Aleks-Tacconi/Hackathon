1. {What is a word in the context of computer processing?}%%%%%{A word is a fixed-sized unit of data that a processor can handle as a single unit.}
2. {What size of unsigned integers can be easily represented in binary?}%%%%%{Unsigned integers, which are non-negative integer numbers.}
3. {What is the largest number that a 64-bit word can hold?}%%%%%{The largest number that a 64-bit word can hold is 2^64-1.}
4. {How many bits are in a byte?}%%%%%{A byte consists of 8 bits.}
5. {What is the largest byte-sized number in decimal?}%%%%%{The largest byte-sized number is 255, which is 2^8-1 in binary.}
6. {What are the four integer types specified in Java and their bit sizes?}%%%%%{int: 32 bits; byte: 8 bits; short: 16 bits; long: 64 bits.}
7. {What is the issue with sign-magnitude representation?}%%%%%{The issue with sign-magnitude representation includes arithmetic problems, such as adding two negative numbers not producing the correct result, and having two representations for zero, wasting a representation.}
8. {What does excess representation do with the range of numbers?}%%%%%{Excess representation starts at -2^n-1 and goes up to 2^n-1 -1.}
9. {In excess representation for n = 8, what does the bit string 00000000 represent?}%%%%%{In excess representation for n = 8, 00000000 represents -128.}
10. {What is the bias in excess representation when the bit strings are written in alphanumeric order?}%%%%%{The bias is 0 in excess representation when the bit strings are written in alphanumeric order.}
