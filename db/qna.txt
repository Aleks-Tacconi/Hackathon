1. {What is a word in the context of computer architecture?}%%%%%{A word is a fixed-sized unit of data that a processor can handle as a single unit.}
2. {What is the largest number that a 64-bit word can hold?}%%%%%{The largest number that a 64-bit word can hold is 2^64 - 1.}
3. {How many bits are in a byte?}%%%%%{A byte consists of 8 bits.}
4. {What is the range of values represented by a signed byte in Java?}%%%%%{A signed byte in Java represents values from -128 to 127.}
5. {In sign-magnitude representation, how is the sign of a number indicated?}%%%%%{The sign of a number is indicated by the left-most bit, with 0 representing positive and 1 representing negative.}
6. {What problem arises when adding two negative numbers using sign-magnitude representation?}%%%%%{Adding two negative numbers does not work properly in sign-magnitude representation.}
7. {What does excess representation allow for in terms of the range of numbers?}%%%%%{Excess representation allows for representation of numbers starting from -2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1) - 1.}
8. {In an 8-bit excess representation, what does the bit string 00000000 represent?}%%%%%{In an 8-bit excess representation, the bit string 00000000 represents -128.}
9. {What is the bias in excess representation, and how is it significant?}%%%%%{The bias in excess representation is 0, and it determines the offset from zero for the encoded numbers.}
10. {What must be done to perform addition in excess representation?}%%%%%{To perform addition in excess representation, you must offset both numbers by adding 2^(n-1) to each before adding them and then subtract 2^(n-1) from the result.}
